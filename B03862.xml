            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER <hi>Written by KING</hi> JAMES To His HOLINESS The POPE, <hi>As 'tis Extracted out of the Regiſters taken at DUBLIN</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>WE did by the Earle of <hi>Melfort,</hi> our principal Secretary of State, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify to your Holineſs the joy we had in your promotion to the Sacred Chair. And thoſe Letters which your Holineſs did with your own handwrite to us, were ſuch teſtimony of Fatherly love, and of your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion for what we ſuffer, that they have leſſened the ſenſe of our Calamity, and have proved of real conſolation to us. The only Source of all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions againſt us is, that we embraced the Catholick Faith; and we do not diſown, but that to ſpread the ſame not only in our three Kingdoms, but over all the diſperſed Colonies of our Subjects in <hi>America,</hi> was our determination. To manifeſt this, there will need no other proof, then to ſee how lately we have proceeded in this Kingdom; for as we have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten the Rebels in ſmall Parties, (which might have been one compleat Victory if they had not obſtinately declined to give us Battle) ſo we have ſtill turn'd all to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Religion, and hope very ſoon to ſee it here finally Eſtabliſhed: Nor will it look hard, if but aided by ſome Subſidies, to compaſſe the ſame in our other Dominions, as ſoon as by Gods favour we ſhall be reſtored, ſeing our People do ſo ill bear the Uſurpers Yoke, and ſo univerſally long for our Return. It would promote this Work if a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peace were ſettled among the Catholick Princes, or a Truce at leaſt, in caſe the time be too ſhort for the other: For this would put an end to theſe Calamities begun in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and where the Hereticks ly now gnawing in the very bowels of the Church. But what need we ſpeak on this Subject, where the things themſelves are ſo Loud, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore your aid. The Apoſtolick Zeal of your Holineſs muſt find out Remedies fit for theſe Evils; and in full confidence hereof, we beſeech God to give your Holineſs a long and Happy Reign. And we being, with all love and filial obſervance proſtrate at your Feet. Do beg your Apoſtolick Benediction.</p>
